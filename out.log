 | JEWEL relies heavily on PYTHIA 6 for the event generation. The modified     |

 | official PYTHIA release and must not be used for anything else. Please      |
 | refer to results as "JEWEL+PYTHIA".                                         |

 | JEWEL also uses code provided byS. Zhang and J. M. Jing                     |
